DESCRIPTION:
Weibull model with delay for time-to-event data
Te is the scale parameter (characteristic time), p is the shape parameter, and del the delay.
Initialization: del = delay before the survival starts to decrease, Te = time at which survival S=0.4 minus delay, p = 1 - 4

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {Te,p,del}

EQUATION:
if t<del
h = 0
else
h = p/Te * ((t-del)/Te)^(p-1)
end

DEFINITION:
Event = {type=event, maxEventNumber=1, hazard=h}

OUTPUT:
output = {Event}
