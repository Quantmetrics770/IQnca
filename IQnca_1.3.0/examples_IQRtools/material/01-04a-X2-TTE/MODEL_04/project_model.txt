DESCRIPTION:
Exponential model with delay for time-to-event data.
Te is the scale parameter (characteristic time).
Initialization: del = delay before survival start to decrease,
Te = (time at which survival S=0.4) minus delay

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {Te,del}

EQUATION:
if t<del
h = 0
else
h = 1/Te
end

DEFINITION:
Event = {type=event, maxEventNumber=1, hazard=h}

OUTPUT:
output = {Event}
