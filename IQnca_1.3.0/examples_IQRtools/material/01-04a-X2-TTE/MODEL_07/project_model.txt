DESCRIPTION:
Log-logistic model for time-to-event data.
Te is the scale parameter (characteristic time) and s is the shape parameter.
Initialization: Te = time at which survival S=0.5, s = 1-4

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {Te,s}

EQUATION:
h = s/Te * (t/Te)^(s-1) / (1+(t/Te)^s)

DEFINITION:
Event = {type=event, maxEventNumber=1, hazard=h}

OUTPUT:
output = {Event}
