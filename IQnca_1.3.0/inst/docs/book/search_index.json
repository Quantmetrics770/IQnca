The cornerstone of this workflow is the generation of the IQdataNCA object that augments the source data with information from the analysis plan and during which data cleaning steps are implemented. The created IQdataNCA object contains all information related to the NCA, namely, the concentration data as well as information about the handling during data representation. With such an approach, the NCA and subsequent steps can be highly automated. The first part of the workflow (Steps 1, 2, and 3) deals with importing the concentration data, applying settings like below the limit of quantification (BLQ) handling or AUC calculation method from the analysis plan, iteratively and interactively cleaning the data and revisiting the point selection for slope calculation. The second part (Steps 4 to 7) converts the data presentation in tables, listings, and figures (TLFs), the NCA, the result presentation in TLFs as well as providing submission-ready material. The latter comprises the calculated NCA parameters as pp and adpp data sets in XPT format and a report with the TLFs can be generated in Word format (with the help of IQReport. In addition the used IQdataNCA object can be exported as an adnca data set in XPT format. 3.1 Import Data In this first step of the workflow the concentration data set is prepared such that it can be used as input to the IQdataNCA function. Concentration data preferentially as a CDISC adpc data set is loaded from the source file and an input data set is created by mapping the columns to required and optional columns as defined in Chapter 5 Data Specification. The specification containing also later derived columns can be displayed by the function dataSpec_IQdataNCA. The table below shows the handled columns of the input data set. There are required columns, columns that are only required for steady-state profiles or intravenous (IV) infusions, optional columns that are used for annotation purpose, and optional covariate columns which comprise typical covariates which can be used for stratification. The table also shows a mapping of CDISC columns to the input columns highlighting an easy translation of an ADaM data set to an input data set to IQdataNCA.

The function IQdataNCA is used to extend the input data set with additional columns. These additional columns for example store information on BLQ data handling, AUC calculation methods, or which time should be used in the subsequent analyses. The user controls these based on the input arguments shown below. By default the arguments are set to most commonly used values. For a complete overview over the data set augmented by the functionIQdataNCA, refer to Chapter 5 Data Specification. Here, an initial slope calculation based on the “Bestslope” algorithm is conducted that is reviewed and refined in the next step. The use of the generation of an IQdataNCA object that combines the input data with the analysis method is exemplified in the following code and Table 3.2 gives an overview of the available settings. dataNCA &lt;- IQdataNCA(data, COMPTYPE = &quot;endogenous&quot;, AUCMETHD = &quot;Linear Log&quot;, FLGBLQPR = &quot;0&quot;) Table 3.2: Settings for data handling and NCA methods Argument Description Default data data.frame with initial definitions COMPTYPE Type of compound: “exogenous” or “endogenous” exogenous FLAGTIME “actual”: actual time used in NCA PK parameter determination, “nominal”: nominal time used in NCA PK parameter determination. Default: “actual” It will be checked if ATIME is defined. If not, then “nominal” will be used. actual FATIMIMP Used in case if basis for analysis is actual time but some actual time point is missing. In this case the user can decide to impute this time point if the nominal time is available. “asis” or “nominal”. “asis”: if missing then it will not be imputed and not be considered in the analysis. If “nominal” then it will be imputed based on NTIME, NTAFD, NDUR and impact TIME, TAFD, and DUR. Default: “asis” asis FLGBLQPR Handling BLLOQ values before first observation above LLOQ. Options: “asis”, “0”, ” LLOQ/2”, “LLOQ”, “missing”. 0 FLGBLQIN Handling BLLOQ values between observations above LLOQ. Options: “asis”, “0”, ” LLOQ/2”, ” LLOQ “,”missing”. missing FLGBLQP1 Handling first BLLOQ value after last observation above LLOQ. Options: “asis”, “0”, ” LLOQ/2”, ” LLOQ “,”missing”. LLOQ/2 FLGBLQPO Handling BLLOQ values after first BLLOQ post last observation above LLOQ. Options: “asis”, “0”, ” LLOQ/2”, ” LLOQ “,”missing”. missing FGBQPLIN Handling BLLOQ values in plots on linear Y axis “asCONC”, asis”, “0”, ” LLOQ/2”, ” LLOQ “,”missing”. asCONC FGBQPLOG Handling BLLOQ values in plots on log Y axis “asCONC”, “asis”, “0”, ” LLOQ/2”, ” LLOQ “,”missing”. asCONC AUCMETHD Defines AUC calculation method. “Linear Log”, “LinearUp LogDown”, “Linear LinearInterpolation”, “Linear LinearLogInterpolation” Linear Log AUCINVAL Character string defining one or more AUC intervals to be calculated. Example: AUCINVAL &lt;- “[0;24];[0;48]”. Note that separators are “;” to allow to store that information also in a CSV file! NA SLOPETOL Tolerance for bestslope algorithm 1e-04 FLAGoverwrite If TRUE then derived columns will be regenerated even if already provided in data (safest). If FALSE then the information in the provided columns will be kept as-is (requires to know exectly what to do). TRUE FLAGignore If TRUE then default rules for exclusion of records from summary tables and NCA parameter calculation are used when applicable (e.g. pre-dose samples &gt;LLOQ). If FALSE then all samples by default are passed through as available in the input data. The first setting is for real use. The second is mainly to allow comparison with results from other NCA tools. TRUE 3.2.1 Ignored observations All observations with missing time or missing concentration as well as observations before the first/single dose for first and single dose profiles of exogenous compounds will be flagged to be ignored from summaries and NCA. For the NCA, pre-first/single dose observations exceeding 5% of the (individual) maximum concentration (Cmax) are flagged specifically. Individual observations can manually be flagged to be ignored from summary tables and/or the NCA as described in the Explore and Clean Data section. 3.2.2 Customized AUC intervals AUCs for customized intervals, i.e., intervals not included as standard intervals from time = 0 to the last observation time, from time = 0 to infinity, or over one dosing interval are specified with the input argument AUCINVAL which is a character containing the start and end times of the interval in squared brackets. Multiple customized intervals can be specified as shown in the example below. If the start or end time of the intervals do not coincide with an observation time, the concentration will be interpolated or extrapolated (see method section on Concentration interpolation/extrapolation). dataNCA &lt;- IQdataNCA(data, AUCINVAL = &quot;[0;12];[0;24]&quot;) 3.2.3 IQRdataNCA export At this step, an IQdataNCA was created. This object can be written to file with an export function. export_IQdataNCA(dataNCA, filename = &quot;dataNCA.csv&quot;) In addition, the dataset can also be exported as an adnca.xpt file. The adnca.xpt dataset, in contrast to an adpc.xpt dataset contains all information about the data used for the NCA, the settings for the algorithm, etc. exportADNCA_IQdataNCA(dataNCA, filename = &quot;dataNCA.csv&quot;) 3.3 Explore and Clean Data In this step, the data is explored to inspect plausibility of the concentration records for outlier detection. Furthermore, the initial slope assessment is inspected to potentially manually revise the data point selection for slope calculation. For the graphical data exploration, the plot function for an IQdataNCA data set provides a detailed overview on the concentration data per individual. # Load prepared IQdataNCA object dataNCA &lt;- load_IQdataNCA(&quot;dataNCA.csv&quot;) # Explore data graphically plot(dataNCA, filename = &quot;InitialExploration.pdf&quot;) One panel per individual and profile is plotted displaying the concentration time course with linear or logarithmic y-axis. The plots are annotated to be informative for data cleaning and refining the slope calculation by: Indicating the points selected by initial slope calculation, Annotating R2 and adjusted R2, Highlighting profiles for which the adjusted R2 is poor (&lt;0.85), Indicating the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), Indicating which records are ignored for summary tables or for NCA, Highlighting the below LLOQ records and their handling method for NCA. The plots may highlight some data issues that may be handled by ignoring specific data points. For example, if one concentration observation seems to be an outlier, or a profile may have been observed for a too short time period to be useful for AUC or slope calculation. Different functions are available for ignoring single records or all records from one subject or profile (see Table 3.3). Subjects or selected profiles from subjects maybe excluded from the NCA while records can be chosen to be ignored in the TLFs, the NCA, or both. Table 3.3: Cleaning functions to ignore records or profiles Function Description Ignored in ignoresubject_IQdataNCA Ignore single or all profiles from a subject from summaries and NCA. Summary plots and tables, NCA ignorerecord_IQdataNCA Ignore record(s) from analysis Generally (listings, individual and summary plots, summary tables, and NCA) ignoreSUM_IQdataNCA Ignore record(s) from summaries Summary plots and tables ignoreNCA_IQdataNCA Ignore record(s) from NCA NCA Note: Records are always kept in the data set but only columns are added that flag records to be ignored. For selection of the records to be ignored, these functions use the unique subject identifier USUBJID, potentially the name of the profile, and - for the records - the record number within the profile IX. These are columns in the IQdataNCA object and are displayed in the exploratory plot such that the user can readily apply the cleaning after the graphical inspection. Importantly, the functions require to give a reason for ignoring or removing the records for traceability which is stored in the IQdataNCA object. # Remove subject from analysis which was not monitored for long enough time period dataNCA &lt;- ignoresubject_IQdataNCA(data = dataNCA, REASON = &quot;Not long enough follow up&quot;, USUBJID = &quot;SAD-Study1-101-101-015&quot;) # Ignore record in NCA dataNCA &lt;- ignoreNCA_IQdataNCA(data = dataNCA, REASON = &quot;Implausible value&quot;, USUBJID = &quot;SAD-Study1-101-101-083&quot;, PROFILE = &quot;Part A Day 1&quot;, IX = c(6, 7)) The graphical exploration including the initial slope calculation could have revealed that the automatic slope point selection is inadequate. For such a case, a manual slope selection can be explored and applied. Using the function slopetest_IQnca, slope calculation for manually selected points can be performed. slopetest_IQnca(data = dataNCA, USUBJID = &quot;SAD-Study1-101-101-122&quot;, IXslope = 6:15) The function returns a graph similar to the exploration graphs provided by the plot function for the IQdataNCA object. Here, only one panel for the profile with the manually selected slopes is displayed. The user can inspect the graph highlighting the selected points and indicating the R2 and adjusted R2 value for the corresponding slope calculation. Once manual slope points are selected such that the slopes are determined satisfactorily, the selection is implemented by updating the IQdataNCA data set using the function slope_IQdataNCA. The input manualslope is a list of entries for each profile identifying the profile and the selected points and can be conveniently created using the function slope_manual_NCA. To all individuals without manually selected data points, the “BestSlope” algorithm will be applied. # Collect information on manually selected slope points manualslope &lt;- list( slope_manual_NCA(USUBJID = &quot;SAD-Study1-101-101-010&quot;, IXslope = c(7, 9:11)), slope_manual_NCA(USUBJID = &quot;SAD-Study1-101-101-176&quot;, PROFILE = &quot;Part B Period 2 Day 1&quot;, IXslope = 10:14) ) # Implement manual slopes dataNCA &lt;- slope_IQdataNCA(data = dataNCA, manualslope = manualslope) Finally, after data cleaning and fine tuning of the slope calculation, the data is “analysis ready”: All method settings and information needed in the following steps, i.e., data presentation in TLFs, NCA, presentation of NCA parameters in TLFs, and generation of the ADPP data set is stored in the IQdataNCA object. It is recommended to rerun the graphical exploration and check the correct implementation of methods, cleaning of records, and slope assessment before exporting the final NCA data set. 3.4 Present Analysis Data The presentation of the analysis data involves simply calling a function for TLFs to be produced. An overview on the functions is presented in Table 3.4. Table 3.4: Functions to produce TLFs for concentration data Function Description Listings listing_conc_IQdataNCA Listing of individual pharmacokinetic concentrations listing_concdetailed_IQdataNCA Listing of individual pharmacokinetic concentrations with information about potential reasons for exclusion, etc. listing_time_IQdataNCA Listing of individual actual timepoints listing_timedetailed_IQdataNCA Listing of individual actual timepoints with information about potential reasons for exclusion, etc. Tables table_summary_conc_IQdataNCA Table with summaries of concentrations per timepoint stratified by treatment (comparing time points within treatment group and profile) table_summary_conc_by_time_IQdataNCA Table with summaries of concentrations per timepoint stratified by timepoint (compare treatments and profiles at same timepoints) Figures figures_indiv_IQdataNCA Figures with indiviudal panels showing concentration timecourses for all profiles for the respective individual.

Can be plotted with linear or log concentration scale and a different color stratification. figure_summary_geommean_dosenorm_IQdataNCA Figures with time courses of geometric mean with geometric standard deviation stratified to different panels by profile and by different colors for treatment group. Can be plotted with linear or log concentration scale and a different color stratification. For all these functions, a TLFs number can be provided that is then included in the caption. The output for a listing or tables is an .Rmd file that can be directly used to compile the listing or table in a Word document in the reporting step. For each function, the figure is printed into a multi-page PDF file. Next to these, an .Rmd file with the same name is generated that imports the figure into a Word document. 3.5 Execute the NCA The NCA is performed by calling nca_IQdataNCA on the IQdataNCA object returning the results as an IQnca object. This object is an R data frame with each row containing the calculated individual NCA parameters and attributes containing additional information like the input data set. result &lt;- nca_IQdataNCA(data = dataNCA) The NCA data set can be exported into a .csv and/or .txt file by the function export_IQnca. Additionally there is also the possibility to export the NCA results to CDISC PP and ADPP .xpt files by using the function exportCDISC_IQnca. 3.6 Present NCA Results The presentation of the NCA results involves simply calling a function for a listing or table to be produced. An overview on the functions is presented in Table 3.5. Table 3.5: Functions to produce tables and figures for NCA parameters Function Description Listings listing_pkparameter_IQnca Listing of individual PKparameters per USUBJID and PROFILE Tables table_summary_byGROUP_pkparameters_IQnca Table of summary statistics of PKparameters per PROFILE, GROUP and a potential additional stratification column table_summary_acrossGROUP_pkparameters_IQnca Table of summary statistics of PKparameters per PROFILE and a potential additional stratification column 3.6.1 Non calculated and unreliably calculated PK parameters Some PK parameters are subject to criteria of reliability. These parameters are: Listings of individual PK parameters will flag all affected values and report the reasons behind non-calculated and unreliably calculated PK parameters, Summary statistics will not consider non-calculated and unreliably calculated PK parameters. Reasons for non-calculated PK parameters are mainly: Terminal slope could not be determined, All values in a profile are BLQ, Dose-normalized values with a dose of 0. Reasons for unreliably calculated PK parameters are: The percentage of extrapolated AUC exceeds 20% of AUCIFO for an individual profile, For IV bolus studies, the extrapolated AUC from time 0 to first data point exceeds 20%, The terminal half-life was determined over a time interval shorter than 1.5 x terminal half-life, Fewer than 3 different time points used to calculate the terminal phase, The coefficient of determination R2ADJ is smaller than 0.85. 3.7 Statistical Analysis The following features will be added to IQnca in the future: Non-inferiority testing, Bioavailability calculation, Bioequivalance testing. 3.8 Reporting IQnca provides the possibility to create comprehensive Word reports consisting of all TLFs, detailing data for each subject, group and profile. For the generation of such report, the IQreport tool is required. For additional details visit the IQreport website. The function report_IQnca gathers all TLFs and other .Rmd files. Then the function IQreport from the package of the same name combines them in a single Word document. This reporting function also adds a title page and a table of contents. The output is the final Word report and a report markdown (.rmd) file, which is an enhanced version of R Markdown (.Rmd). The Report Markdown format is used to add features to the Word report not supported by R markdown.

For each individual example, the data contains a different combination of administration and profile type, and also the AUC calculation method varies. Example 1 is an introductory analysis on bolus single dose data, demonstrating the visualization of the source data and the handling of outliers. Additional to the PK parameters calculation, the AUC on user selected intervals is calculated. Example 2 handles LLOQ values and manual slope selection using infusion single dose data. A final report is generated showing listings, tables and figures. Example 3 uses extravascular data containing both single dose and steady-state profiles. Through manual slope selection, the calculation of a slope is tried to be improved upon. A final report is generated showing listings, tables and figures. Example 4 compares the output PK parameters of the IQnca calculations with those of WinNonlin, using the Theoph R data set. Example 5 treats an edge case of the treatment of pre-dose entries. 4.1 Example 1: Bolus single dose data This first example is a case study of an analysis with manual slope selection. The WinNonlin data set used is an IV bolus single dose data which can be found in examples/03_book_examples/Example_1/IV_Bolus_Single_Dose.xls. The data stems from a study X where the drug A was administered by IV to a group of 4 subjects. The drug was given as a 10,000 ug bolus dose. The given time unit is “Minutes”, the dosing unit is “ug” and the concentration was measured in “ng/mL”. More information about the dosing can be found in the supplied dosing data Dosing_Used.xls. In this example the AUC is determined by using the linear trapezoidal method on increasing parts of the curve and the logarithmic trapezoidal method on decreasing parts. Additionally, the AUCs of the time intervals [0H,6H] and [0H,12H] are calculated. 4.1.1 Data preparation As a first step, import the source data set: # Navigate to example folder setwd(&quot;examples/03_book_examples/Example_1/&quot;) # Load the data set dataFile &lt;- &quot;IV_Bolus_Single_Dose.xls&quot; dataOrig &lt;- readxl::read_excel(dataFile) The first 15 rows of this data set are shown below.

A preliminary step is to modify the original data set according to the IQnca specification. The names of existing relevant columns need to be mapped to column names given by the specification. Furthermore, required columns which are missing from the data set need to be added manually, provided such information exists. Table 3.1 (or calling dataSpec_IQdataNCA()) gives information on the necessary columns to build a minimally functioning example. Columns in the original data set which do not have a counterpart in the specification may simply be ignored. ## Renaming columns of the original data set and adding additional information data &lt;- data.frame( USUBJID = dataOrig$Subject, STUDYID = &quot;Study X&quot;, COMPOUND = &quot;Drug A&quot;, ANALYTE = &quot;Drug A&quot;, MATRIX = &quot;Plasma&quot;, PROFILE = &quot;Single Bolus Dose (SD)&quot;, PROFTYPE = &quot;SD&quot;, GROUP = &quot;10000 ug&quot;, GROUPN = 10000, GROUPU = &quot;ug&quot;, DAY = NA, ATIME = NA, NTIME = as.numeric(dataOrig$Time), TIMEUNIT = &quot;Minutes&quot;, ACONC = as.numeric(dataOrig$Conc), CONCUNIT = &quot;ng/mL&quot;, LLOQ = 0, # Faking LLOQ ADM = &quot;Bolus&quot;, DOSE = as.numeric(dataOrig$Dose), DOSEUNIT = &quot;ug&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE ) In this example the columns ID, TIME, CONC, DOSE from the source data set were mapped to USUBJID, NTIME, ACONC, DOSE. The dosing information stems form the Dosing_Used.xls data.

In this example the AUC on increasing parts of the concentration curve is calculated by the linear trapezoidal method, and for decreasing parts the logarithmic trapezoidal rule is used (see section 6.6). Similarly, interpolation on increasing parts is done by linear rule and on decreasing parts by logarithmic rule. By setting the parameter FLAGTIME as “nominal” the TIME data from the original data set is taken as nominal time. Furthermore, by giving a character string of intervals in the parameter AUCINVAL, the AUC on those intervals may be returned. For more detailed information about the functionality of IQdataNCA refer to Chapter 5 Data Specification. An example of special handling of below LLOQ values is shown in Example 2. dataNCA &lt;- IQdataNCA(data, FLAGTIME = &quot;nominal&quot;, AUCMETHD = &quot;LinearUp LogDown&quot;, AUCINVAL = &quot;[0;6];[0;12]&quot;) Table 4.3: First five rows of the IQdataNCA object.

A first exploratory look into the data can be made by using the plot.IQdataNCA function. This plotting function is best used for data exploration; for reporting, different functions are used (see Example 2 Section 4.2.3). Individual plots show the individual profiles in different panels. The observation points are overlaid with labels, indicating the number of the sample (column IX in the IQdataNCA object).

The data stems from a study Y where the drug B was administered as a single infusion IV dose with a dosing of 300 mg/m2 to 3 subjects and 400mg/m2 to 2 subjects. More information about the dosing can be found in the supplied dosing data Dosing_Used.xls. The given time unit is “Hours”, the dosing unit is “mg” and the concentration was measured in “ug/mL”. In this example the AUC is determined by using the linear trapezoidal method on the curve before the time to Cmax (Tmax) and the logarithmic trapezoidal method for the part after Tmax. Possible interpolation is done by using the linear or logarithmic rule, on the respective parts of the curve. An alternative BLQ value handling will be applied. A report of the data and results is then generated using the following figures, listings and tables: Figures Multiple stratified spaghetti concentration plots, Individual plots of the concentration data, Mean plot of the concentration, Geomean plots of the concentration. Listings Concentration listing, Time sampling listing, PK parameter listing. Tables Concentration summary table, PK parameter summary table. 4.2.1 Data preparation # Navigate to example folder setwd(&quot;examples/03_book_examples/Example_2/&quot;) # Load the data set dataFile &lt;- &quot;IV_Infusion_Single_Dose.xls&quot; dataOrig &lt;- readxl::read_excel(dataFile) The first 15 rows of this data set are shown below.

This is a characteristic of WinNonlin data sets which needs to be modified before using the IQdataNCA function since the concentration columns (ACONC) may only be numeric. In cases like this it is important to replace the strings by values smaller than the LLOQ (here the LLOQ is 5).

While the plot.IQdataNCA function is useful for data exploration, for reporting more sophisticated plotting functions are being used. The figures are exported into PDF files and also into .Rmd code is generated which is used for the final report. For a complete list of plotting functions, see Table 3.4. 4.2.4.1 Summary level plots Summary level plots show the data in the same plots. Both on linear and log Y axis and both untransformed and dose-normalized. For each GROUP and PROFILE, a separate plot is created. In this example there are two dosing groups and a single profile. Stratification by various columns of the data is expressed by the coloring of the curves. In the following example the spaghetti plot is stratified by USUBJID. ## Create and save a spaghetti plot as pdf, log10 scaled y-axis, stratified by USUBJID (default) figure_spaghetti_IQdataNCA(dataNCA, logY = TRUE, strat = &quot;USUBJID&quot;, filename = &quot;output/figures/spaghetti_1.pdf&quot;) The horizontal dashed line in the figure above marks the LLOQ.

A 10 mg dose of C was given once daily for one week to 10 healthy individuals. PK profiles in plasma were monitored on Day 1 and after the last dose on Day 7. For Day 1, the profile was obtained for the dosing interval whereas the Day 7 profile monitored the washout up to one week after the last dose. To investigate and compare the PK characteristics after first dose and at the assumed steady-state, an NCA is conducted for both profiles. The AUC is to be calculated based on linear trapezoidal rule before the maximum concentration and based on logarithmic trapezoidal rule afterwards. The standard settings for BLQ handling are applied. 4.3.1 Data exploration The PK data is provided in the IQncaData input format, i.e., all required columns for importing the data as IQRdataNCA are prepared. # Navigate to example folder setwd(&quot;examples/03_book_examples/Example_3/&quot;) # Load input data set prepared for IQdataNCA import dataInput &lt;- IQRloadCSVdata(&quot;EV_Steady_State_First_Dose.csv&quot;) head_tbl &lt;- formatData(head(dataInput, n = 5), title = &quot;First five rows of the minimally required data set&quot;) head_tbl &lt;- kableExtra::scroll_box(head_tbl, width = &quot;100%&quot;) head_tbl Table 4.8: First five rows of the minimally required data set USUBJID STUDYID COMPOUND ANALYTE MATRIX PROFILE PROFTYPE GROUP GROUPN GROUPU DAY ATIME NTIME TIMEUNIT ACONC CONCUNIT LLOQ ADM DOSE DOSEUNIT TAU 1 Z C C Plasma First dose FD 10mg_OD_Oral 10 mg 1 0.0000 0.0000 Hours 0.3689 ng/mL 1 EXTRAVASCULAR 10 mg 24 1 Z C C Plasma First dose FD 10mg_OD_Oral 10 mg 1 0.1667 0.1667 Hours 24.2235 ng/mL 1 EXTRAVASCULAR 10 mg 24 1 Z C C Plasma First dose FD 10mg_OD_Oral 10 mg 1 1.0000 1.0000 Hours 74.1386 ng/mL 1 EXTRAVASCULAR 10 mg 24 1 Z C C Plasma First dose FD 10mg_OD_Oral 10 mg 1 2.0000 2.0000 Hours 134.2214 ng/mL 1 EXTRAVASCULAR 10 mg 24 1 Z C C Plasma First dose FD 10mg_OD_Oral 10 mg 1 4.0000 4.0000 Hours 131.8492 ng/mL 1 EXTRAVASCULAR 10 mg 24 Such, the input dataset can readily be imported by IQdataNCA for analysis preparation, i.e., defining the analysis setting in the data set.

This may be accomplished by duplicating the pre-dose rows and appending them to the previous day. Note that then the duplicated values are used twice for AUC calculation, once as last record of the previous day and once as pre-dose value. Also the duplicated records are listed twice for listings and table.

"],["dataspec.html", "5 Data Specification 5.1 IQdataNCA Function 5.2 IQdataNCA Object", " 5 Data Specification 5.1 IQdataNCA Function The function IQdataNCA takes the source data set and extends it by adding columns containing information about the handling of the data and the methods used in the NCA. In this way, all options and choices by the user about the analysis are stored in one place. This augmented data set, namely the IQdataNCA object, is then ready for the NCA parameter calculation. 5.2 IQdataNCA Object The IQdataNCA object is the source data set augmented by a fixed number of columns which are added through the function. These added columns may be empty or contain default values if they cannot be derived from the data or user input. Note that some column names from the source data set need to be mapped beforehand according to the IQdataNCA specification. The types of columns in the IQdataNCA object are: Required: columns from the source data set which are minimally required by IQdataNCA, Conditionally required: columns from the source data set, conditionally required depending on profile and administration type, Optional: columns from the source data set used for annotation of the data set, Covariate: columns from the source data set, Index/Flag/Comment: defined by user input, these columns flag records which are to be ignored, with corresponding comments, Time: columns containing time data, derived from the original time data of the source data set, Blloq: columns containing information about the handling values below the LLOQ, defined by user input, Concentration: columns containing concentration data, derived from the original concentration data of the source data set, Slope: parameters calculated by the best/manual-slope algorithm NCA: columns indicating the AUC calculation method to be used, and intervals for corresponding interval AUC calculation.

Section NCA models provides an overview on the profiles types handled by IQnca for NCA. Details of the underlying methodology to derive the terminal slope as well as the AUC are discussed in Terminal slope calculation and AUC calculation methods. A complete overview on the implemented PK parameters and on when they are calculated is given in Overview of NCA parameters. 6.1 Grouping and profile differentiation The analysis data is annotated with a GROUP and a PROFILE name that are used for annotation and stratification. Data of one individual can contain multiple PK concentration profiles. For example, for a cross over study studying food effects in which single dose profiles are measured in part A and part B the profile names could be: “Part A - single dose fasted”, “Part B - single dose fed”. Each subject furthermore belongs to a group which is used for annotation and further stratification. Typically, the treatment, e.g., “200 mg o.d.”, would be used for the group. The group and the profile names are used throughout the analysis. Individual data listings and figures with individual data per panel are annotated with group name and profile. Summary tables and plots are always generated per profile, but may also be stratified by the group. 6.2 NCA models Depending on the profile type and the type of administration, different NCA models are applied. The NCA model decides which parameters are derived during the analysis. Currently, IQnca supports the following profile types and administration types for the analysis of blood and plasma samples: Table 6.1: NCA models Type Category Option Profile Type Single Dose First Dose Steady Statea Administration Type IV Bolusb IV Infusion Extravasculara a Unique pre-dose sample required. b Pre-dose sample is substituted by extrapolation In case multiple profiles are provided for a subject, IQnca splits the data internally per unique profile and administration type and applies the corresponding NCA model. 6.3 Pre-dose data handling Pre-dose samples are identified by negative times or the time being equal to zero. They are kept in the data set as is and reported and presented unchanged in the listings of individual concentration data or plots of individual data. Positive pre-dose concentrations above the LLOQ are flagged for first or single dose profiles of exogenous compounds and handled as missing in summary tables and NCA. The NCA requires a concentration at dosing time (i.e., C0) for a complete AUC calculation. C0 is defined as the pre-dose observation in the data set for infusion and extravascular administration. In case of bolus administration a pre-dose concentration is required to have time zero such that it is defined as C0. Imputation of C0 is needed if the pre-dose sample is missing or in case of bolus administration has a negative time. Imputation rules are summarized in Table 6.2 and the description of C0. Note that the imputed values of C0 are not considered for determining Tmax/Cmax or Tmin/Cmin and that only one pre-dose sample per profile is allowed. Table 6.2: Missing pre-dose imputation for AUC calculation Exogenous compound Endogenous compound Administration Single/First Dose Steady State Single/First Dose Steady State Bolusa back-extrapolatedb back-extrapolatedb back-extrapolatedb back-extrapolatedb Infusion or extravascular 0 minimum observed concentration over dosing interval minimum observed concentration minimum observed concentration over dosing interval Note: Only one pre-dose sample allowed per profile. Imputed values are not considered for Tmax/Cmax and Tmin/Cmin calculation. a Imputation of missing as well as pre-dose samples with negative time. b Log-linear regression of first two data points. Or, if one of the values is negative or the second concentration is smallerthan the first, the first non zero concentration is imputed 6.4 BLQ data handling Concentration records that are below the LLOQ, called BLQ data, are flagged in the dataset by checking whether the actually recorded concentration value is below the LLOQ. Data that are actually below the limit of detection are not handled separately, but are pooled with the BLQ data. BLQ data need special handling for the data presentation and summary in listings, tables and figures as well as the NCA. 6.4.1 For Listings In listings of individual data, concentrations below the LLOQ are displayed as “BLQ” or “BLLOQ (&lt;\\(lloq\\))” with \\(lloq\\) being the numerical value of the LLOQ. 6.4.2 For Summary Tables and NCA The alternative BLQ handling methods that can be used for summary tables and NCA are described in Table 6.3. BLQ observations are handled differently for the cases shown in Table 6.4 that also indicates their default setting in IQnca. Table 6.3: BLQ handling methods Method Description asis Keep value as reported in original data zero Impute zero value LLOQ/2 Impute LLOQ/2 value LLOQ Impute LLOQ value missing Handle as missing (do not use for calculations) Table 6.4: Conditions for which BLQ methods are defined separately Condition Default BLQ handling method BLQ observation before the first observations above the LLOQ 0 BLQ observation in between observations that are above the LLOQ missing BLQ observation the first observation after the last observation above the LLOQ* LLOQ/2 BLQ observation following the first observation after the last observation above the LLOQ missing Note: When determining the condition for each observation, ignored records are not considered. These are observations with missing time or concentration values and can include manually selected records. * Requires following BLQ observations. A single BLQ observation at the end of the profile will be handled as observation in between observations above the LLOQ. Note that the same settings are used for summary tables and NCA. If zero imputation is used the corresponding concentrations are used for arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD), but not for the geometric summary statistics. 6.4.3 For Individual and Summary Plots Per default, the settings applied for NCA and summary tables are adopted when plotting individual or summary PK concentrations. Alternatively, the applied BLQ handling method is only conditioned on whether the y-(concentration) axis that is used in a particular plot is linear or log transformed. That is, one of the BLQ handling methods listed in Table 6.3 is applied to all BLQ observations when plotting on linear scale. Another or the same is used for all BLQ observations when plotting on log transformed scale. Summaries, e.g., arithmetic or geometric means, are calculated considering these settings meaning that a summary value displayed in a plot may not be the same as listed in a table if different BLQ settings are used. 6.5 Terminal slope calculation The terminal slope is determined by least-squares of a regression line to log-transformed terminal concentration data points. The PK parameter \\(\\lambda_z\\) is defined as the negative of the regression slope which is determined analytically with \\(t_i\\) and \\(\\bar{t}\\), the times and corresponding mean, as well as \\(cl_i\\) and \\(\\bar{cl}\\), the log-transformed concentration and corresponding mean. \\[ \\lambda_z = - \\text{slope} = - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (t_i-\\bar{t}) (cl_i-\\bar{cl})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (t_i-\\bar{t})^2} \\] The goodness of the fit is described by the coefficient of determination, R2, and its adjusted version. \\[ R^2 = -\\lambda_z \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (t_i-\\bar{t}) (cl_i-\\bar{cl})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (cl_i-\\bar{cl})^2} \\] \\[ R^2_{adjusted} = 1 - (1 - R^2) \\frac{n - 1}{n - 2} \\] The selection of terminal data points to be used for slope calculation can be done automatically or manually. The “BestSlope” algorithm which is implemented in IQnca and is used per default is described in the following section. 6.5.1 Automatic terminal slope selection The algorithm considers all observations from the maximum value to the last nonzero observation. The slope and corresponding adjusted R2 is determined for the last three, the last four, etc. and all observations under consideration. The finally selected data points are defined as the highest number of terminal points that achieve an adjusted R2 within a defined tolerance compared to the largest adjusted R2 achieved over all tested sets of data points. The slope is not determined if only two or fewer data points are available or if all concentration values are identical. 6.6 AUC calculation methods The AUC calculation is based on the trapezoidal method using either the linear trapezoidal rule or the logarithmic trapezoidal rule. That is, for each AUC segment between two consecutive observations, \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\), the AUC is determined as the product of either the arithmetic or the logarithmic mean of the concentration and the time interval (\\(t_2 - t_1\\)). Equations for the AUC per observation interval based on the linear of logarithmic rule are given in AUC interval calculus. All segment AUCs are then added to give the total AUC for the considered time range (e.g., over the dosing interval, the observed time range, or a user-defined time interval). The AUC calculation for the considered time range may require the imputation of concentrations if no observation is available for the start or end time points. For example, no trough measurement was taken and the AUC over a dosing interval for a steady-state dose is calculated, or if the user requires to determine the AUC for a time span with a start or end time not included in the observation times. Imputed concentrations are determined via linear or logarithmic interpolation before the last observed time point or by extrapolation after the observed time point. Note that concentrations before the first observed time point are interpolated between C0 and the first observed time point. Extrapolation is based on the terminal slope (cf. section on slope calculation) of logtransformed values. Of note, the extrapolation of the AUC to infinity is a special case of extrapolation of a concentration to a time point after the last observation and is handled analogue. The calculus of the interpolated and extrapolated concentrations as well as for the AUC extrapolated to infinity are described in Concentration interpolation/extrapolation. IQnca provides four different options consisting of combinations of linear or logarithmic AUC calculation and linear or logarithmic concentration interpolation, which can be selected by the parameter AUCMETHD in the function IQdataNCA. Table 6.5 indicates in which cases the linear or logarithmic version of each method is used. Extrapolation of AUC to infinity is based on the last nonzero concentration and the terminal slope on log-scale. Table 6.5: AUC calculation options Option Trapezoidal rule for AUC of interval* Interpolation of concentration† Linear Log linear before Tmax, logarithmic after Tmax linear before Tmax, logarithmic after Tmax‡ LinearUp LogDown linear if c2 &gt; c1, logarithmic if c2 &lt; c1 linear if c2 &gt; c1, logarithmic if c2 &lt; c1 Linear LinearInterpolation linear linear Linear LinearLogInterpolation linear linear before Tmax, logarithmic after Tmax‡ Note: Concentrations are extrapolated using the terminal slope on logarithmic scale. * In case that at least for one of the endpoints of an interval the concentration is zero or negative or the concentrations at the endpoints are the same, the linear trapezoidal rule is used. † If a to-be-interpolated point lies in an interval where at least one of the endpoint concentration is zero or negative, linear interpolation is used. ‡ In case of BOLUS administration where C0 &gt; CMAX, logarithmic interpolation and logarithmic trapezoidal rule determining AUC is also used for points inbetween C0 and CMAX Notes on exceptions from the general rule settings for AUC calculation for a segment Linear trapezoidal rule is always used if any of the concentrations defining a segment is negative or zero or the concentrations are equal. In these cases, the logarithmic mean is not defined, In case of BOLUS administration and if the extrapolated value of C0 is larger than CMAX, the logarithmic trapezoidal rule determining the AUC is used for the whole profile. Notes on whether linear or logarithmic interpolation/extrapolation is used Extrapolation to later timepoints is always performed on logarithmic scale using the terminal slope that was estimated for the respective profile, Extrapolation to earlier timepoints is performed on linear scale, Linear interpolation is always used if the to-be-interpolated concentration lies in an interval where at least one endpoint concentration is zero or negative or the endpoint concentrations are equal. In case of BOLUS administration where C0 &gt; CMAX and logarithmic interpolation is chosen for observations after Tmax, logarithmic interpolation is also used for points between C0 and CMAX Extrapolation cannot be performed and the corresponding AUC cannot be determined if no calculated slope is available. 6.6.1 AUC interval calculus The AUC and the area under the first moment curve (AUMC) for an interval between two consecutive observations based on the linear trapezoidal rule is calculated as follows. \\[ \\left. AUC \\right|_{t_1}^{t_2} = \\frac{c_1 + c_2}{2} \\cdot \\left( t_2 - t_1 \\right) \\] \\[ \\left. AUMC \\right|_{t_1}^{t_2} = \\frac{t_1 \\cdot c_1 + t_2 \\cdot c_2}{2} \\cdot \\left( t_2 - t_1 \\right) \\] Using the logarithmic mean instead of the arithmetic mean, the AUC and AUMC are calculated according to the following equations. \\[ \\left. AUC \\right|_{t_1}^{t_2} = \\frac{c_2 - c_1}{\\ln(\\frac{c_2}{c_1})} \\cdot \\left( t_2 - t_1 \\right) \\] \\[ \\left. AUMC \\right|_{t_1}^{t_2} = \\frac{t_2 \\cdot c_2 - t_1 \\cdot c_1}{\\ln(\\frac{c_2}{c_1})} \\cdot \\left( t_2 - t_1 \\right) - \\frac{c_2 -c_1}{\\ln(\\frac{c_2}{c_1})²}\\cdot \\left( t_2 - t_1 \\right)² \\] 6.6.2 Concentration interpolation/extrapolation Interpolated concentrations \\(\\hat{c}\\) are calculated as follows via linear interpolation of two consecutive observations either using the original values (\\(\\hat{c}_{\\text{lin}}\\)) or logarithms of the concentration values (\\(\\hat{c}_{\\text{log}}\\)). \\[ \\hat{c}_{\\text{lin}} = c_1 + \\left| \\frac{\\hat{t}-t_1}{t_2 - t_1} \\right| \\left( c_2 - c_1 \\right) \\] \\[ \\hat{c}_{\\text{log}} = \\exp \\left( \\ln(c_1) + \\left| \\frac{\\hat{t}-t_1}{t_2 - t_1} \\right| \\left( \\ln(c_2) - \\ln(c_1) \\right) \\right) \\] Extrapolated concentrations \\(\\tilde{c}\\) are determined via the terminal slope \\(\\lambda_Z\\) from the last observed value \\(c_{last}\\). The last observed value is the last value that is not missing or below the limit of quantification (BLQ). \\[ \\tilde{c} = c_{last} \\cdot \\exp \\left(-\\lambda_Z \\cdot (\\tilde{t} - t_{last}) \\right) \\] For the special case of \\(\\tilde{t} \\to \\infty\\), the extrapolation of the concentration results in an extrapolated AUC after the last observation according to \\[ AUC_{E} = \\frac{c_{\\text{last}}}{\\lambda_Z} \\] 6.7 Overview of NCA parameters A large number of NCA parameters is provided per individual and as summary tables by IQnca. Depending on the route of administration and type of profile of the considered data, the created output differs and is automatically adjusted by IQnca. The following tables provide an overview over all NCA parameters included in IQnca. Parameters are divided into three tables depending on the type of profile data: Parameters derived for all types of profiles (Table 6.6) Additional parameters derived only for single/first dose profiles (Table 6.7) Additional parameters derived only for steady-state dosing (Table 6.8) Further the tables are subdivided by the admissible administration profiles BOLUS, INFUSION and EXTRAVASCULAR. For the formulas used to calculate the parameters see Table 6.9. 6.7.1 Last observation defintion The parameter TLST is defined as the last timepoint at which the concentration is greater than the lower limit of quantification. This is the default behavior. An alternative definition is setting TLST as the last timepoint where the concentration is non-zero. The latter can be achieved by setting the parameter CTLASTwinnonlinbehavior as “TRUE” in the function nca_IQdataNCA. Note that this alternative definition includes possible values which are imputed as “LLOQ” or “LLOQ/2” as non-zero concentration values. 6.7.2 For all profile types Table 6.6: Parameters derived for all types of profiles.

TIMEUNIT MRTEVIFP MRT Extravasc Infinity Pred Mean residence time from dosing time to infinity, extrapolated using CLSTP. TIMEUNIT MRTEVLST MRT Extravasc to Last Nonzero Conc Mean residence time from dosing time to TLST. TIMEUNIT BOLUS C0 Initial Conc Concentration at dosing time. Note that the parameter is only listed in case of BOLUS administration. If there is no concentration at time zero available, then C0 is calculated by the following rules: For INFUSION and EXTRAVASCULAR administration: If there is a concentration with negative time point (pre-dose), that time is set to zero and the respective concentration becomes C0. Else if there are only positive time points: SINGLE DOSE and FIRST DOSE data: for exogenous compounds set C0 to zero, for endogenous compounds set C0 to the minimum observed. STEADY STATE data: set C0 to the minimum observed in the dosing interval TAU. For BOLUS: If there is no concentration value at time zero, then C0 is always extrapolated as follows: Find C0 by performing backwards extrapolation by log-linear regression of the first two concentrations C1 and C2. In case of C1 &lt; C2, or C1 or C2 non-positive, set C0 equal to the first positive concentration after time zero instead. C1 and C2 are the first two consecutive concentrations after time zero, after removal of outliers. CONCUNIT AUCPBEO AUC %Back Extrapolation Obs Percentage of AUCIFO due to back extrapolation of C0 if the first measured concentration is not at dosing time. % AUCPBEP AUC %Back Extrapolation Pred Percentage of AUCIFP due to back extrapolation of C0 if the first measured concentration is not at dosing time. % BOLUS/INFUSION MRTIVIFO MRT Intravasc Infinity Obs Mean residence time from dosing time to infinity, based on AUCIFO, in case of BOLUS and INFUSION administration.
